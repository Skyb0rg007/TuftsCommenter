#### Privacy Policy

This application will not store any information about it's customers because there is actually no way to do so.

The Facebook API is used to post comments through a single Page token, "customers" never see or create this token.

Additionally, the google forms is not registered with any specific Google Script: the script is on the Google Sheets
This means that it is impossible to do anything with the specific users, and the only visible data is comment id, comment, and timestamp.

(Facebook if you read this I am innocent pls let me tag pages in my comments)
